# Class etiquette

.pull-left-wide[
<br>

- Learning how to code can be challenging and might lead you out of your comfort zone. If you have problems with the pace of the course, let me and the TAs know. I expect your commitment to the class, but **I do not want anyone to fail.**
- You are all genuinely interested in data science. But there is also considerable variation in your backgrounds. This is how we like it! Some sessions will be more informative for you than others. If you feel bored, **look out for and help others**, or explore other corners of R you don't know yet.
- **Be respectful** to each other, all the time. This includes the TAs and me.
- **Ask questions** whenever you feel the need to do so!

## What is data science?

> "Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> "Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data." - [Chikio Hayashi](https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085)

Overall, there's **no consensus** - it is a buzzword after all. We're going to carry on with Conway's working definition.

# Types of data-driven research and their role for policy

.pull-left-small2[
## 1. Description
- What is the state of the world?
- What are the trends over time?
- What are the differences between groups?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **monitoring**
- "How many people consume misinformation online?"
- "How many people are unemployed in a certain district?"
- "How does the distribution of income vary across educational segments of the population?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 2. Explanation
- What is the effect of a policy?
- Does the effect vary across groups?
- What are the mechanisms behind the effect?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **evaluation**
- "Did the wage increase lead to a decrease in employment?"
- "Did the campaign affect the exposure to misinformation differently across groups?"
- "Why did the intervention not lead to the expected results?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 3. Prediction
- What is the path of an indicator?
- (When) will future events happen?
- What class does this observation most likely belong to?


## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **forecasting** but also **targeting** and **measurement**
- "Will there be conflict?"
- "How many people will be unemployed in a certain district next year?"
- "Which individuals are most likely to be affected by a policy?"

# The COMPAS algorithm to predict criminals' recidivism

.pull-left[
## Background

- Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) is a decision support tool developed by Northpointe (now Equivant) used by U.S. courts to **assess the likelihood of recidivism**
- Produced several scales (Pretrial release risk, General recidivism, Violent recidivism) based on factors such as age, criminal history, and substance abuse
- The algorithm is proprietary and its inner workings are not public

# The COMPAS algorithm to predict criminals' recidivism

.pull-left[
## The ProPublica and other investigations

- In 2016, ProPublica published an investigation showing that COMPAS was **biased against African Americans**
- **Bias:** The algorithm was more likely for African Americans to wrongly predict that defendants would re-offend.
- **Accuracy:** only 20% of people predicted to commit violent crimes actually went on to do so (in a later study estimated with 65%, still worse than a group of humans with little expertise)

# Why R and RStudio?

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

--

### Bridge to multiple other programming environments, with statistics at heart

- Already has all of the statistics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

--

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.
- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

# Attendance

## General rules

- You cannot miss more than two sessions. If you have to miss a session for medical reasons or personal emergencies, please **inform Examination Office** and they will inform me about your absence. There is no need to notify me in advance or ex post.
- We will check attendance on-site.
- The current **Hertie hygiene rules** apply!


---
# Office hours and advice

-  If you want to discuss content from class, please first do so in the lab sessions. 
- If you still need more feedback on course topics, use the Moodle forum.
- If you want to discuss any other matters with me, drop Alex Karras, my assistant, a message (`r fa('envelope')` [karras@hertie-school.org](mailto:karras@hertie-school.org)) and he will arrange a meeting.

# Assignments and grading

| Component                           | Weight |
|:-|-:|
| 4(5) × homework assignments (10% each) | 40% |
| 4(5) × online quizzes (5% each) | 20% |
| 1 × workshop presentation/attendance 	| 10% |
| 1 × hackathon project       | 30% |

--

### Homework assignments 
- The assignments are distributed via our own [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/113288608-introduction-to-data-science-fall-2024).
- Each assignment is a mix of practical problems that are to be solved with R.
- You are encouraged to collaborate, but everyone will hand in a separate solution.
- There will be 5 assignments (one every ~2 weeks; see [overview on GitHub](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/assignments)) and the 4 best will contribute to the final grade.
- You'll have one week to work on each assignment (deadline: Tuesdays at 9:30am).
- You submit your solutions via GitHub.

### Workshop presentation (MDS students)
- On October  28, 14-20h, we will flip roles and you will become instructor of a data science workshop session.
- You, in groups of 2 students, will present a data science workflow tool (randomly [allocated](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/workshop-presentations)).
- Your contribution will include:
  1. A lightning talk (recorded) where you briefly introduce and motivate the tool
  2. A hands-on session where you showcase the tool and provide practice material
- Both the recorded talk and the materials will be graded.
- Check out the materials from previous workshops online [`>2021<`](https://intro-to-data-science-21-workshop.github.io/) [`>2022<`](https://intro-to-data-science-22-workshop.github.io/)
[`>2023<`](https://intro-to-data-science-23-workshop.github.io/)!
- **MPP/MIA students**: You will not give a talk, but have to actively participate in the workshop.

### Hackathon project
- On December 2, 13-16h, there will be a hackathon hosted at Hertie.
- At the hackathon itself, we introduce the data and provide an environment that should facilitate you getting started with the project and form groups of 3-4 students.
- Two weeks later, on December 16, the project instructions will be made available. You will then have 48 hours to submit your solutions.
- The task is similar to the homework assignments but puts more emphasis on creative problem-solving using the tools and techniques you have learned in class.

# AI use in and for the course



.pull-left-wide[

### Can AI tools (LLM interfaces, AI pair programming) be used for assignments?

- Yes, but use them with care. You will not become an efficient programmer if you heavily rely on those tools without learning the basics.
- The Hertie School has installed [teaching guidelines on the use of AI Tools](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/news/allcontent/detail/content/hertie-school-defines-guidelines-for-use-of-artificial-intelligence-software-at-university) in Spring 2023. We will stick to those guidelines.
- Some key elements from the guidelines:
  - "Familiarity with AI tools is helpful for the learning experience and the professional development of students afterwards, ..."
  - "... but needs to be done with clear guidelines on ethical use, biases, and limits of the tools that are currently available."
  - "[T]he use of AI tools for the preparation of assignments (...) needs to be clearly referenced in the text."
